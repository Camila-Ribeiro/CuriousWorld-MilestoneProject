## Testing
The website was tested many times and I conducted a user test with two users. A few bugs were found during this process like  

bla bla blaclicking on the button "Read More" wasn't opening the right page, was 404 error or pages weren't opening in a new tab which now is all fixed.
 
Part of the testing was done 

[Testing file](../blob/master/Testing.md) ?? check if it correct
 
The website version for mobile and ipad works very similar to the desktop and Ipad pro version except the deck cards across the desktop and Ipad pro are placed on set of 2 or 3 cards in a row and for mobile it is stacked.
